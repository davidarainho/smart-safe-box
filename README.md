# smart-safe-box
This project was developed in the context of the *Systems Engineering* course (1st year, *Master in Electrical and Computer Engineering*) at the *Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto* (FEUP).
The team is composed of 12 members chosen randomly, having the following branch distribution: 1 - Energy, 2 - Telecommunications, Electronics, and Computers, and 9 - Automation.

# Project Description
Here is the information presented to us at the beginning.

> Description:
> Smart lock is used to lock and unlock a safe box. 
> The system has two interfaces with the user:  
>  .One is a keypad mounted on the system.  
>  .The other interface is a mobile App.  
>   
> High-Level Requirements:  
> 	.Users can set a new code from both the keypad and mobile app. Both update each other.  
> 	.When a user enters the correct code, the box is unlocked.  
> 	.When the wrong code is entered, the mobile app is notified.  
> 	.Indoor use.  
> 	.Wifi-based network.  
>   
> Outcome:  
> A prototype of the system and the development of an APP is expected.  
  
How was the project developed?  
The following System Breakdown Structure shows how we subdivided the subsystems:

This git project is subdivided into its 3 main Subsystems: Application, Server, and Hardware.
Due to our lack of knowledge/practice, there are techSpikes folders so as to learn and practice the concepts needed, for each one.
Also, there is a documentation folder with the deliverables required for the course (Quality manual, System Concept, Intermediate report, and final presentation).

The hardware code wasn't committed because of reasons. Please don't ask why! I don't know either!

# Installation
At https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dc8HDGR2haiSnXzkiW8UsI2eDp7OAUKH?usp=sharing you may find the APK so as to install the app. Unfortunately, we have tuitions to pay and so it is impossible for us to maintain the Google server running. :')

# Prerequisites
The app works for Android 8.0 version or higher (minSDK of 26)

# Utilization:
