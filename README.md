# smart-safe-box
This project was developed in the context of the *Systems Engineering* course (1st year, *Master in Electrical and Computer Engineering*) at the *Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto* (FEUP).
Our team is composed of 12 members chosen randomly, having the following branch distribution: 1 - Energy, 2 - Telecommunications, Electronics, and Computers, and 9 - Automation.

# Project Description
Here it is presented the information presented to us at the beginning.

> Description:
> Smart lock is used to lock and unlock a safe box. 
> The system has two interfaces with the user:
> 	.One is a keypad mounted on the system.
> 	.The other interface is a mobile App.
> 
> High-Level Requirements:
> 	.Users can set a new code from both the keypad and mobile app. Both update each other.
> 	.When a user enters the correct code, the box is unlocked.
> 	.When the wrong code is entered, the mobile app is notified.
> 	.Indoor use.
> 	.Wifi-based network.
> 
> Outcome:
> A prototype of the system and the development of an APP is expected.

How was the project developed?
The following System Breakdown Structure is shown how we subdivided the subsystems:

This git project is subdivided into its 3 main Subsystems: Application, Server, and Hardware.
Due to our lack of knowledge/practice, there are techSpikes folders so as to learn and practice the concepts needed, for each one.

The hardware code wasn't committed because of reasons. Please don't ask why! I don't know either!

# Installation
At [link] you may find the APK so as to install the app. Unfortunately, we have tuitions to pay and so it is impossible for us to maintain the Google server running. :')

# Pre-requisites
The app works for Android 8.0 version (minSDK of 26)
[server pre-requisites]

# Utilization:
## Video:
At [link] you may find the video demonstration of the system running. :)
